		lyrics: 'Born to roam in a spurious maze<br>The landmarks washed by the sorrowful tears<br>Our way is lost in a mystery haze<br>The walls made of our fears<br><br>Out of wrath, just to face a new grief<br>We act forgiveness holding a grudge<br>Our heart is quiet like a thief<br>Our mind is a silent judge<br><br>Maze of sorrow …<br><br>Keep on going wherever it goes<br>We bump ourselves into somebodies back<br>Falling down and nobody knows<br>If this is the only track<br><br>We’re strong enough to get up off our knees<br>We’re smart enough just to feel it’s all wrong<br>Every time we try to release<br>We can’t stand it all too long<br><br>Maze of sorrow …<br><br>Emotions never lead to other side<br>leaves you someday<br>No time to meditate, no place to hide<br>We all have lost the way<br><br>So, do you think you’re ready to<br>Escape and break the walls<br>If only you had known the truth<br>Your sight gets clear when the curtain falls<br><br>So, do you think you’re ready to<br>Accept the secret call<br>If only you had known the truth<br>Your mind is open when the curtain falls All’s in us<br>If you just raise your eyes<br>You’ll see the boundless skies<br>There will be no more lies',
